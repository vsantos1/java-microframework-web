## Project description

This project is a web legacy project with JavaEE,
it is a web application that allows you to manage products and customers.
With the good practices of the MVC pattern, it is a project that allows you to learn the basics of how the
MVC pattern works and how to implement it in any web application.

I made it to learn and remember how old web applications were made, and how to implement old technologies in new
projects.
